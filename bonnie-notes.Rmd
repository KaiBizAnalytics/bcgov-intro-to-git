## Software Carpentry Likes

#### General Thoughts

- Like the learning objectives, don't love they way they are laid out.  I'd prefer seeing the question be a header and the objectives clearly outlined either above or below.
- teaching command line will take extra time as we'll need to teach that
- keep things simple: change directory, list directory contents, make and delete a directory then git commands.

#### Summary and Set Up

- We have installation instructions in a git repo already - copy and paste to this directory?
- Ask ppl to show up ready-to-go with a git account, git installed, m2FA, RStudio (tbd), Git Bash?
- can we include the configuration as well?

- MacOS has a terminal running a bash or zsh shell for command line work.  Windows...Git Bash?

#### Episode 1. Automated Version Control
- not keen on the cartoon
- yes for the document flow diagrams

#### Episode 2. Setting Up Git
- am concerned this will lose ppl
- can we pass them a script before hand to work through?
- yes to touching on default branch naming (inclusive language)

#### Episode 3. Creating a Repository (Local)
- mostly good, like the keypoints at the end
- making a subdirectory, 
- .gitgnore and .gitkeep
- they don't mention .gitkeep but this is a gotcha later on

#### Episode 4. Tracking Changes
- which editor?  will people be open to using nano? I'm guessing not, and the changes should be a
word doc or excel file.  we could mention R scripts here. ppl might find themselves in trouble when
when -m is omitted.
- yes to git log
- no to git diff (intermediate level)
- I don't think there will be time (in a 1/2 day workshop) to do the exercises
- exercises as a takeaway

#### Episode 5. Exploring History
- this is a deeper dive and could be rushing things to include.  If we include it, it needs a rethink.  To me, this section feels like a bunch of information being tossed out, with no specific purpose.

#### Episode 6. Ignoring Things
- will need to touch on this as we don't want ppl pushing data to GitHub

#### Episode 7. Remotes in GitHub
- authentication method - 2FA, ssh keys or PAT
- GitHub password vs authentication
- https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github

#### Episode 8. Collaborating
- skip this section

#### Episode 9. Conflicts
- skip this section

#### Episode 10 - 13 
- collapse these into one unit where we discuss bcgov organization, licensing, code-sharing, PIA/STRA etc.   
- Would like to lean on Stephanie for assisstance here

#### Episode 14. Supplemental: Using Git from RStudio
