#### General Thoughts on SW Carpentry Course

Bonnie

Like the learning objectives, don't love they way they are laid out. I'd prefer seeing the question be a header and the objectives clearly outlined either above or below. Teaching command line will take extra time as we'll need to teach that. Keep things simple: change directory, list directory contents, make and delete a directory then git commands.

SW Carpentry Episode 5. Exploring History: this is a deeper dive and could be rushing things to include. If we include it, it needs a rethink.
