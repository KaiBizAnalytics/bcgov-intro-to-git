## Pre-workshop Assignment

To make the most of our time together on the day of the workshop, we would like you to show up ready-to-go with the proper software installed and configured correctly on your local machine. After working through the installation instructions, please the following in a single Word or PDF document.

#### 1. A screen shot of your git configurations

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. We'll talk a little more about this in the workshop.

Open the application Git Bash on your local computer and enter the following commands at the command prompt. The command prompt will likely be a combination of your name, computer number and a filepath and ends with `$` The email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account.

```         
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name in Quotes"
$ git config --global user.email "youremail@gov.bc.ca"
```

Then enter the following and take a screen shot of the command-line output.

```         
$ git config â€“list
```

#### 2. Your GitHub handle.

You can see this when you sign in to GitHub and click on your avatar at the top right. Your GitHub handle is in bold font above your name.
