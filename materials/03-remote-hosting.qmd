Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with other people. We already have most of the machinery we need to do this ; the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between two repositories. The repositories can live on separate computers or network locations. In practice, we often use one copy as a central hub, and keep it on the web rather than on someone’s laptop. Most programmers use a hosting service like GitHub to hold the central repositories; and this is true for many BC Government employees.

If you recall, in the pre-workshop, you created a GitHub account and associated it with your GitHub handle (or ID). You also configured your computer with a token (PAT) in a way that should seamlessly allow us to to create a remote repository on GitHub that will be linked to our local repository. Then we will share the changes we’ve made to our current project with the world.

## 3.1 **Creating a Remote Repository**

Log in to GitHub, then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a new repository called `planets`:
